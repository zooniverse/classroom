# Zooniverse Classrooms

Zooniverse Classrooms (formerly Education API Front End, or edu-api-front-end)
is the [Zooniverse's](https://www.zooniverse.org/) web portal for educational
tools, designed for Teachers and Students who want to learn more about science
using real world people-powered research projects.

The website is available at [https://classroom.zooniverse.org/](https://classroom.zooniverse.org/)

Zooniverse Classrooms is divided into different **Programs** that cater to
different fields of study, and each Program is usually also associated with a
specific Zooniverse project.

Currently available Programs:
- **Astro 101 with Galaxy Zoo**
  - Has materials and tools for introductory astronomy students.
  - Associated projects: [Galaxy Zoo 101](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/galaxy-zoo-in-astronomy-101/) and [Hubble's Law](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/intro2astro-hubbles-law/)
- **Zooniverse-based Activities for Undergraduates** (WIP)
- **WildCam Darien Lab**
  - Educational tool for students and explorers interested in learning about ecology, using real world camera trap data from the jungles of Panama.
  - Heavy focus on using geographical map data.
  - Associated project: [WildCam Darien](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/wildcam/wildcam-darien)
- **WildCam Gorongosa Lab** (WIP)

## Usage

__Install the dependencies:__

`npm install`

__Test:__

`npm run test`

__Development mode with livereload:__

`npm run start`

__When you are done, create a production-ready version of the JS bundle:__

`npm run build`

#### Alternatviely run it via docker & docker-compose
Depends on [docker install](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
1. `docker-compose build`
2. `docker-compose up`

Or get a bash console where you can run `npm` cmds via the built container (ensure step 1 above is done)
`docker-compose run --rm --service-ports classrooms bash`

Run the tests via docker
`docker-compose run --rm classrooms npm run test`

## Deployment

Deployment is handled by Github Action. Both staging and production deployment can be run ad hoc in the actions tab as needed if you have the appropriate permissions on the repository.

### Staging

On merge to master, a Github Action is triggered to deploy to staging to `https://classroom.preview.zooniverse.org`.

### Production

Production deployments are triggered by an update to which commit the `production-release` tag is pointed to. This tag should be updated via chat ops and then a Github Action will run that builds and uploads the files to our cloud provider found at `https://classroom.zooniverse.org`.

## External Dependencies

Core:
- [Zooniverse Education API](https://github.com/zooniverse/education-api) service - this backend server is the backbone that manages classrooms, assignments, user roles, etc.
- [Panoptes App setup](https://panoptes.zooniverse.org/) - standard requirement for allowing Zooniverse users to login.

See the [config](src/lib/config.js) file for the service URLs and app IDs.

All Programs:
- Zooniverse project with classroom setup - required to allow students to submit classifications as part of a classroom.
  - TODO: This requires more documentation.

Astronomy Programs:
- Caesar - used for exporting the data generated by a classroom.
- Google API setup - required for integration with Google Drive.

WildCam Programs:
- [Carto](https://carto.com/) map database - used by WildCam-type Programs for accessing geographical map data.
- Various mapping services - use by WildCam-type Programs for providing the visual map layers.

See the [config](src/programs/darien/wildcam-darien.map-config.js) file of a sample WildCam-type Program for an idea of the mapping services used.
