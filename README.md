# Education API Front End (Zooniverse Classroom)

The Education API Front End (also known as the Zooniverse Classrooms, for
reasons that will become obvious) is the [Zooniverse's](https://www.zooniverse.org/)
web portal for educational tools, designed for Teachers and Students who want to
learn more about science using real world people-powered research projects.

The website is available at [https://classroom.zooniverse.org/](https://classroom.zooniverse.org/)

Zooniverse Classrooms is divided into different **Programs** that cater to
different fields of study, and each Program is usually also associated with a
specific Zooniverse project.

Currently available Programs:
- **Astro 101 with Galaxy Zoo**
  - Has materials and tools for introductory astronomy students.
  - Associated projects: [Galaxy Zoo 101](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/galaxy-zoo-in-astronomy-101/) and [Hubble's Law](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/intro2astro-hubbles-law/)
- **WildCam Darien Lab**
  - Educational tool for students and explorers interested in learning about ecology, using real world camera trap data from the jungles of Panama.
  - Heavy focus on using geographical map data.
  - Associated project: [WildCam Darien](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/wildcam/wildcam-darien)
- **WildCam Gorongosa Lab** (WIP)

## External Dependencies

Core:
- [Zooniverse Education API](https://github.com/zooniverse/education-api) service - this backend server is the backbone that manages classrooms, assignments, user roles, etc.
- [Panoptes App setup](https://panoptes.zooniverse.org/) - standard requirement for allowing Zooniverse users to login.

See the [config](src/lib/config.js) file for the service URLs and app IDs.

All Programs:
- Zooniverse project with classroom setup - required to allow students to submit classifications as part of a classroom.
  - TODO: This requires more documentation.

Astronomy Programs:
- Caesar - used for exporting the data generated by a classroom.
- Google API setup - required for integration with Google Drive.

WildCam Programs:
- [Carto](https://carto.com/) map database - used by WildCam-type Programs for accessing geographical map data.
- Various mapping services - use by WildCam-type Programs for providing the visual map layers.

See the [config](src/programs/darien/wildcam-darien.map-config.js) file of a sample WildCam-type Program for an idea of the mapping services used.
